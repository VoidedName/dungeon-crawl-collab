# Main Goals

The following list of potential features will guide us in building a minimal valuable product. Our dungeon crawler MVP requires some of these high level goals:


## Major MVP Design Goals

- enjoyable replayability
- a feeling of choice
- progression system
- a variety of unique enemies 
- three character classes a player can start as (wizard, warrior, rouge)
- a level up system with ability to increase base character stats
- a rougelite experience (you die, you lose everything)

## Story / Theme

You are an adventurer who is traveling through the forest to get to a nearby town.  You happen to step onto loose soil which breaks way causing you to fall down into a dungeon.  No clue where this dungeon came from and no way to climb out, your only option is to explore the dungeon and find an exit.  The first level is small, but as you reach the stairs down you find a bloody journal on the ground which explains how there are 10 levels to the dungeon and there is an exist, but blocking the exit is a boss

The dungeon is dark and grungy, but luckily you always travel with a torch and weapon that will help light your surroundings or fight off the evils you may encounter.  As you get deeper into the dungeon, you notice the dungeon becomes larger and there are more difficult creatures you must fight.  You figure the fight with the boss will be difficult, so you try your best to prepare your character.

## Character Classes

each character has a unique way to be played and attack style.  Also, there is no concept of mana, just ability cooldown.  Each play has a set of skills that can be improved after leveling up.  These skills need to be leveled up / unlocked, so until a player reaches level 2, they will only have their primary and secondary attack mechanics.

A primary attack is used for damaging enemies.  All character classes have a mechanic for charging up their primary attack which will deal more damage but require charging (reduces movement speed).

A secondary attack is used for protecting the character (shields, roll, evasion, deflection, etc)


### Wizard

- primary attack: the wizard has a basic ranged attack which fires a magic bolt; charging will make the shot have a larger hitbox, fly faster, and deal more damage.
- defense attack: deflect (incoming projectiles will reverse in direction and potentially hurt enemies)
- normal walk speed
- mechanics
  - the damage of the bolt can be increased by equiped items or perks
  - the attack speed can also be increased

- skills
  - ignite (catches an enemy on fire for DOTs)
  - freeze (freezes an enemy and turns them blue, they walk slower for 3 seconds)
  - nova (AOE attack which hits all nearby enemies)

### Warrior

- primary attack: swing sword
- secondary attack: block with shield (blocks projectiles but slows movement)
- slower walk speed

- skills
  - spin attack (hits all enemies in a 360 radius)
  - ground slam (smashes the ground which sends out a shockwave to damage & stun enemies)
  - charge (run fast in a direction which will damage and shove back enemies in the collision path)


### Archer

- primary attack: charge attack bow
- secondary attack: roll (archer will roll in the walking direction to avoid projectiles)
- the archer has a bow and arrow which the player can click and hold to charge up
  - the archer's bow will turn bold when it's fully charged
  - higher charge means more damagage, and a fully charged shot can have special effects
- faster walk speed compared to the other characters
- move slower when charging their shot

- skills
  - rapid fire (shoots 3 quick arrows)
  - stealth (vanish from enemies for 5 seconds, attacking while in sneak will cause double damage but make you visible again)
  - poision bomb (throws a projectile which poisions any enemies)

## Mechanics

- a player can cast his abilities by pressing a key on his keyboard.
- players can move while attacking
- the map has a fog of war until you discover rooms and walls
- the map has darkness that your player light will illuminate
- going to the next level involves interacting with stairs
- players can pick up items and use items
- players can equip items they find

## Replayability

- after beating the boss, he will drop an unlock which you can use at the start of the next run
- games and maps are randomized, so every gameplay experience will be different

## Enemies

Enemies will randomly spawn in rooms around the map.  The cooridors between the rooms will not have enemies.  Once a player comes within range of an enemy, the enemy will chase the player up to a certain range; otherwise it will run back to it's starting room and wander around.  Balancing the game might be hard, so we may have to have a preset of common "mobs" you will see, for example, 2 skeletons, 2 traps, and an archer might turn out to be a good combination for a level 3 mob. 

To allow a feeling of progression and challenge, each enemy may need the ability to increase in levels as well.  As enemies increase in levels, they will have more health points and possibly deal more damage.  The goal is to reduce the size of the mobs and instead require players to play strategically room to room.  To prevent the player from just rushing through the game, enemies may need to get stronger as we get closer to the end of game.  The level of the enemy could potentially be visualized by sprites with armor, or different tint of enemies, or just a level above the enemies heads.
