Outline here... dunno yet. Some bullet points on what we want somewhere, right?

* Real Time
* 2D Grid based
** Diagonal Movement?
* Class System
** fixed?
** free?

== Branching And Contribution Model
To start with, we'll be using two branches. `main` and `dev`.

* `main`: Update through PR from `dev` only.
* `dev`: Update through PR from any other branch only.

To contribute, please make a PR (pull request) against dev.
